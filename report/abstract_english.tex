Computers emit low bandwidth acoustic signals, i.e. sounds audibly by the human ear and up to several hundred kHz. 
This phenomena exposes several computers for acoustic side channel attacks by adversaries who wants to gain information about what operations the CPU is performing, and possibly extracting cryptographic keys. 

In this paper we build a portable and a lab grade setup that we use to verify the existence of the acoustic side channel found in numerous computers.

Our results clearly enhances the suspicion of the existence of interpretable acoustic emanations from the range 0-100kHz.
We also demonstrate that the acoustic fingerprints vary a lot depending on the processor, thus the signal can be indistinguishable on some newer CPUs.
