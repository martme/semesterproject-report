Computers allegedly emit low-bandwidth acoustic signals, i.e. acoustic emanations from the audible range of the human ear and up to several hundred kHz. 
This phenomenon exposes computers to acoustic side-channel attacks, as adversaries can obtain information about internal operations on the CPU, which can possibly be used to extract cryptographic keys.

In this paper we build a portable and a lab-grade setup, and use them to analyze the information in the suggested side-channel for several computers.

Our empirical analysis of frequency spectrograms resulting from our experiments enhance the suspicion that there exist information leakage through an acoustic side-channel in the frequency range 0-100kHz.

We are able to distinguish between different CPU operations and variations in CPU workload by evaluating frequency spectrograms.
We also demonstrate that the acoustic signatures of different hardware configurations vary significantly.
