\section{Microphone selection}\label{sec:microphone_selection}

Our experimental setup uses the Zoom H4n Handy Recorder. 
The recorder is able to record WAV files with a sampling frequency of 96kHz and a quantization of 24 bit. We were also able to plug it directly into a computer, thus using it as the standard sound input device. 
However this limited the operating sampling frequency to 48kHz.

Since a lot of the information we are looking for is in a frequency range far above the hearing range of the human ear, we require a microphone that can capture these frequencies. 
The frequencies we are able to observe are limited to the Nyqyust frequency.

\begin{equation}\label{Nyquist frequency}
F = \fraq{Fs}{2}
\end{equation}
